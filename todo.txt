shader test suite
automatically try to convert and compile shader if error happens try a fix and then continiue to other shader until all shaders fixed
this can be done trough a page on app and send the error info to console app using ipc then implement fix then reload the app window and try again
write a console command for it that connects to the active app process so copilot can test out stuff its self and continiue to iterate
